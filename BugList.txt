U64MB Bug List


* = Introduced in the current update (or unable to be duplicated in Kaze's original splitscreen release)
** = Improvement for splitscreen
*** = IMPORTANT
**** = This bug could be kept in, doesn't break gameplay in any way

[the first 30 here are singleplayer bugs only, second group contains misc bugs in singleplayer and multiplayer]
0. The HUD is positioned too high on the screen with GlideN64's Overscan disabled
1. Text strings are missing/incorrect (for example the text that shows when you enter BOB is the splitscreen text, the text string when you talk to King Bob Omb is missing, and the text string for the bob omb buddy opening the cannon is missing, which soft locks the game)
2. Pause screen instantly unpauses if 2 controllers are plugged in (on emulator) and can even crash if both controllers press pause at the same time (on hardware)
3. Game file A is instantly selected if 2 controllers are plugged in (on hardware, and emulator)
4. Unable to select Star missions, star screen is near instantly skipped if 2 controllers are plugged in (on hardware, and emulator)
5. Up-C no longer moves the Mario Bros.'s head around.
6. Ending needs to have both Mario Bros. appear for consistency with the voice lines and animations
7. Getting into a cannon crashes the game.
8. Talking to a pink bob-omb to open a cannon soft locks the game, but you are still able to pause and exit the level.
9. Unable to get Game Over.
10. Boss cutscenes do not seem to be restored
11. You start with 2 lives in multiplayer, but 0 lives in single player (update, emulator simply doesn't count lives properly in single player). Consider reversing so 1 Up's have a purpose in multiplayer (earning you bubbles, instead of having bubbles for free). This could be a positive effect on Co Op.
12. No audio after the ending, so no credits music and no "thank you so much for as to playing my game"
13. Feedback on power meter is that it is too small for Single Player. Likely can't be fixed because we need it that small for Co Op.
14. the Goddard head touch points are still in the center, even though the model is not
15. Peach is muted in Luigi's ending.
16. Speaking to Yoshi softlocks the game.
17. Dying in single player turns you into a bubble after death animation before Bowser laugh screen exits the level. (low priority, if it can't be fixed due to needing the bubble for Co Op, not a big deal)
18. Framerate on File Select screen is very choppy. Likely frameskip's fault.
19. Game crashes (on hardware for some, and emulator for all) when loading new areas of levels. For example; SSL's boss fight, Bowser Sub Area in DDD, and WDW's underwater town.
20. Koopa the Quick has Bob-Omb buddy dialogue and voice before he gives you his star.
21. If a player triple jumps with Luigi near the edge of a building (Example: Shifting Sand Land Koopa Shell building), Luigi gets stuck in the edge basically T-posing, just like Mario constantly falling off the edge without really falling. However, Luigi just gets stuck in a frame of the animation doing nothing.
22. Merry-Go-Round music still plays when a player exits it in BBH. Mr. I shoots his goo and it crosses the door. Not only that, if they exit the room behind this door, they kinda get an X-ray vision, making them see a Scuttlebug behind walls.
23. If you enter the tunnel to fight Eyerok in SSL's pyramid, the game straight up crashes (on hardware and emulators).
24. When Luigi triple jumps while getting a Wing Cap, he does a weird motion before flying.
25. One can get stuck on the "awning" in SSL.
26. If a player long jumps on the Jolly Roger's walls they clip through it and fall immediately into water.
27. The platform that balances in LLL and BITFS doesn't, and if a player stands on it they can seem clipping through it.
28. Various Co-op teleports weren't disabled for 1P mode and thus crash the game.
29. In the ending cutscene where it shows all the stages, the player can pause and exit out of them.
30. You can pause and exit anytime in any given stage.

Single Player Ending Bugs
Single Player Mario - mario/luigi is kissed twice, when mario strikes a pose after being kissed, the camera switches too early to the next angle, no music
Single Player Luigi - no voices at all, when luigi strikes a pose after being kissed, the camera switches too early to the next angle too, also no music as well

*** -2. Motos's and Ice Motos's models are broken, fix it
***-1. level select: when Co-Op is selected, incrementing the level counter does it twice instead of once, meaning only odd numbered levels can be selected.
*0. Player 2 can no longer press buttons to skip dialogue, only player 1.
*1. The opening Dialog for stage 2 is duplicated from stage 1. This is the only instance of this bug, all other stages have their normal opening dialog.
***2. Hurtbox feels *huge* - but in case it's enemies having seemingly huge hitboxes, Piranha Plants, Goombas, Clams, Scuttlebugs, Skeeters, Bunches of enemies in the Sandlands. Moles. All Shy Guys. Koopas. Lakitus. Moneybags. Spindrifts. (this list is almost guaranteed to be incomplete sadly)
*3. King Bob-omb Boss Music does not play
*4. Kuromame, Shy Guys, and single shot Bowser breath won't burn Luigi
5. "let's-a go!" voice clip does not have enough time to play to completion
6. Hoot the Owl still generates dialogue.
7. Dialogue does not freeze players in place.
8. Amps won't shock Luigi.
9. Luigi doesn't say "So long gay bowser!" **would it work if we added a sound specifically for Luigi?
10. When both players die, Bowser's laugh doesn't seem to play the entire duration?
11. Standing on Dorrie's head as either player will not raise her head up.
12. Unsure if volcano explosion hurts either player...
13. Ring detection is extremely off in The Manta Ray's Reward
*14. Big Boo's Balcony; Big Boo will not come onto the balcony forcing you to ground pound all the way back to the ground every time you want to hit him. Makes it easier overall since you never have to worry about being hit. ***fixed***
15. Cool Cool Mountain's Snowman Head still produces dialogue.
*16. Swimming camera on Jolly Roger Bay and outside the castle is all screwed up. 
17. (from Inky) entering another room while one player dies at the point where the transition would happen makes both players receive death eject knockback when entering the room (or knocked out of the painting if during a level transition such as finishing the Secret Slide as one player while the other player dies)
18. Wet/Dry world can only be entered with the water drained unless both players jump into the painting at the same time.
19. Monkey bugs; after the monkey takes your hat and you catch him, he becomes invisible. When you put him down, he becomes visible again but you can't put your hat back on. Monkey and anyone who takes your hat, always the Mario hat (which it's OK, it can be Mario's hat, it's the same way it works in Odyssey for some reason)
20. Dialogue still exists for the monkey at the top of the mountain in the Monkey Cage star. (that may be just so you can free him, nevermind)
21. Sides of cannon do not rotate properly with cannon.
*22. Crashes when I try to go to the mirror room. ***fixed***
23. Bowser level 1: Painting does not transition from Peach to Bowser as you get closer. Is simply Bowser. (may be a gfx plugin issue)
*24. Crashes during the ending.*******************
*25. Bully type enemies are unable to collide with Luigi.
**26. Since the Snowman's Land painting can't be seen in the mirror room as the Mirror is removed, why not place the painting on the wall????
**27. Why don't we make the 2nd Bowser fight take two bombs to win?
*28. Flying speed is way too high
*29. Tilting platforms such as those in BiTFS and LLL Tilt, however the visual model does not tilt with it.
*30. We should disable the L button triggering the ending. It's annoying.
***31 & 32. entering Eyerok's room in SSL and the loading zone to the submarine area in DDD crash
***33. Power meter is too small in singleplayer mode
****34. If you crouch under a player who just collected the star and is still in mid-air, he won't do the star animation and you'll be able to still play the level after collecting a star, which would make you go back to the castle.

Newest Bugs
1. Mario and Luigi lose their voices after starting the race with Koopa the Quick in THI. 
2. if Bubba eats either of them, that respective player cannot respawn properly. After their respawn bubble is popped, they respawn as a glitchy "invisible" character that eventually becomes frozen.

3. [BUG FIXED]

4. HUD scales differently from Single Player (who cares? which one is the correct one? Hard to say.) https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/749001228498894889/759490288216571924/4gdwvn.gif
5. Yoshi dialog should be restored in 2P **or Yoshi should be ridable right off the bat outside.**
**6. Luigi's power meter is the shape of Mario's head
